In line with SDG 3, the goal is to contribute to global efforts in ensuring access to safe and nutritious food. Unsafe food is a significant threat to health, contributing to the spread of foodborne illnesses and impacting the well-being of millions worldwide.
**Project Overview:**
We have developed a web application equipped with advanced image recognition technology to assess the freshness of fruits and vegetables. This tool serves as a preventive measure, enabling users to make informed decisions about the safety of their food consumption.
**Key Features:**
1. **Image Recognition:** Our application uses state-of-the-art machine learning models trained on a diverse dataset to accurately identify signs of spoilage or staleness in fruits and vegetables.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing individuals from various backgrounds to easily navigate and utilize the application.
3. **Educational Resources:** We provide valuable information on proper food storage, handling, and the potential health risks associated with consuming spoiled or contaminated food.
Impact on SDG 3:
1. **Reducing Foodborne Illnesses:** By empowering individuals to identify and avoid consuming rotten or stale food, we contribute to the reduction of foodborne illnesses, a significant factor affecting global health.
2. **Promoting Healthier Diets:** Access to safe and fresh food is a cornerstone of a healthy diet. Our application encourages users to make healthier food choices, aligning with the goal of improving overall well-being.
